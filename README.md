## About The Project

ChromaType is a lightweight web utility for creating beautiful, colorful text art. Inspired by the striking visual identity of the Google Gemini CLI, this tool uses the classic "Rebel" FIGlet font to render blocky, retro text, and then brings it to life with customizable gradients.

Whether you're creating a unique social media banner, a stylized title for a project, or just having fun with ASCII art, ChromaType provides a simple, intuitive, and powerful interface to bring your ideas to life. It runs entirely in your browser with no build steps or server-side processing required.

Try it out [here](https://diyard.github.io/chromatype).
